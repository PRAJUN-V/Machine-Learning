Provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.

Pandas:
Data manipulation and analysis library.
Provides data structures like DataFrames, which are essential for handling structured data.

Matplotlib and Seaborn:
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive
and informative statistical graphics.

Scikit-learn:
A powerful and simple library for classical machine learning algorithms.
Includes tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning Libraries,

TensorFlow:
An open-source deep learning library developed by Google.
Used for building and deploying machine learning models, particularly deep learning models.

Keras:
A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
Simplifies the creation and training of neural network models.

PyTorch:
An open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.
Known for its dynamic computational graph and ease of use.

Specialized Libraries,

Widely used for winning Kaggle competitions and for its efficiency in handling large datasets.

LightGBM:
A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms.
Designed to be distributed and efficient, making it ideal for large datasets.

CatBoost:
A gradient boosting library that handles categorical features automatically.
Developed by Yandex, it is known for its ease of use and performance.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries

NLTK:
Natural Language Toolkit, a comprehensive library for working with human language data.
Useful for tasks such as tokenization, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

spaCy:
An open-source library for advanced NLP.
Designed for industrial-strength NLP, providing fast and efficient tools for tasks like named
entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging.

Transformers (Hugging Face):
A library providing state-of-the-art machine learning architectures like BERT, GPT, and more for NLP tasks.
Simplifies the use of transformer models for tasks like text classification, translation, and summarization.

Data Handling and Preprocessing Libraries,

Dask:
A parallel computing library that scales Python code from laptops to large clusters.
Useful for handling large datasets that don't fit into memory.
